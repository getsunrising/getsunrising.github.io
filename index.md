## Get sun rising
In Feb 28th, I was determined to shake some very bad habits of mine and seek to become the man years ago,
 a man fearless to many difficuties that I am afraid now,
 a man ignorant of many many uselss junk information that I now hold,
 a man who once said "Good books give you much wisdom; 90% of the Internet contnent is junk.".


Today I would like to declare here: the good days for me has now **gone**.

# Day 0
From tomorrow, the **SET** getup time is now mutable: _6:30_. Arrange your fall to bed time in advance!
Lets see whether I can achieve it tommorrow morning.
